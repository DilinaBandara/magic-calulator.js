# Magic Calculator

## Functionality:

### Display
This will show the current number.

### Buttons for digits 0 to 9
These will be used to enter a starting number.

### Reset button
This will clear out the current number and reset the calculator to the initial state.

### Magic button
This button will perform the “magic” operation. This magic operation has 3 behaviors.
- Behavior 1: add 5
- Behavior 2: multiply by 2
- Behavior 3: subtract 3

The behavior to be applied is decided by the number of times the magic button is pressed (after
the initial state).
If it is the first press, behavior 1 will be applied. If it is the second press,
behavior 2 will be applied and if it is the third press behavior 3 will be applied. 
For the forthpress, behavior 1 will be applied again. 
For the fifth press, behavior 2 will be applied again. And
so on.
